              I’m a passionate software developer and electrical
              engineering student with a strong track record of
              building innovative web applications and systems

                <p>
                  My journey into software development began
                  during my early studies, where I discovered my
                  passion for coding and creating solutions that
                  make an impact. Since then, I’ve worked on a
                  variety of projects, including a hospital
                  management system and a modern attendance
                  tracking app, leading teams and delivering
                  results that simplify complex processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, I’ve earned recognition for my
                  academic excellence, including being one of
                  the top students in my country and
                  contributing to my community through volunteer
                  work and ICT initiatives. I’m driven by
                  continuous learning and staying ahead with the
                  latest technologies and best practices in both
                  software and hardware domains. I believe in
                  continuous learning and staying up-to-date
                  with the latest technologies and best
                  practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring
                  new technologies, contributing to open-source
                  projects, or sharing knowledge with the
                  developer community through blog posts and
                  mentoring.
